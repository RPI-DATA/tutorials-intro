All code and results are the [TruckVotes.ipynb](https://github.com/samkennerly/TruckVotes/blob/master/TruckVotes.ipynb) notebook. (If it looks wrong, try a different browser. Math was not typeset correctly when I used Firefox, but it worked in Chrome and Safari.)

Raw data files are in the [Data](https://github.com/samkennerly/TruckVotes/tree/master/Data) folder.
